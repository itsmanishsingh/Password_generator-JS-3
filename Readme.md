### Steps to approach 

1. arr1 = ["a","b","c,"d","e","f","A","B","C","D","E"];
2. arr2 = [1,2,3,4];
3. arr3 = ["!","@","#"];

password length =10;

arr1char = 6
arr2char = 2
arr3char = 2

generatedPassword = []
generate 6 random numbers from arr1
access these 6 values;
push these values in generated Password 


generatedPassword = []
generate 2 random numbers from arr2
access these 2 values from arr2;
push these values in generated Password 

generatedPassword = []
generate 2 random numbers from arr3
access these 2 values from arr3;
push these values in generated Password
